# Cryptoparty Library

The Cryptoparty Ann Arbor library, inspired by [anonbib][anonbib]
and [Isis Agora Lovecruft's library][isis-agora-lib], is a collection
of books, papers, and other media that is relevant to the cryptoparty.
Feel free to grab your own copy to store offline!

This is a community project, so contribution of books, papers and
organization is greatly appreciated!

## Safety

This will surely contain lots of PDFs, which can be dangerous. We can't
practically guarantee their safety, so you read at your own risk.
Reading from inside a VM, or perhaps on a disconnected device could be a
good idea.
